This is my personal webpage containing some course experiences. I created it in the beginning of 2022, so it does not have any experiences after. Also, I no longer update the webpage because it takes too much time to think about the layout of the page. I used html and css to create the page, and the webpage of 'Web Development' inside the 'Project' on the top navigation bar was created by using html, css, and jquery.
