This is my [personal webpage](https://rob12312368.github.io/Rob.github.io/Tsao-Ching.html) containing some course experiences. I created it in the beginning of 2022, so it does not have any experiences after. Also, I no longer update the webpage. I used html and css to create the page, and the webpage of [Web Development](https://rob12312368.github.io/Rob.github.io/%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E6%9C%9F%E6%9C%AB/index.html) inside the 'Project' on the top navigation bar was created by using html, css, and jquery.
